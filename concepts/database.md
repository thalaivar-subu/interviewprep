# Database


## Redis
- Key-Value, Stored In RAM, Cache, Pub/Sub, On Top Of Some Persistend Database

## Wide Column
- Cassandra, HBASE - Denormalized - No commments, posts, authors -> users, posts by useers, comments by users
- Same like SQL, but unstructured - CQL - No Joins, Easy to scale up, horizontal scaling
- Time Series, High Write/ Low Read, Historical Records

## SQL
- Table Oriented, Schema, ACID Compliant, Difficult to scale

## Search Engine
- Elastic Search - Similar to document oriented databse but inverted index

## NoSQL
- Mongo Document Oriented, JSON
Nested faster, then join with ref id
Mongo Supports Geo Spatial Queries, Data Aggregation Pipelines
